# Aira-boat - A Chatbot for Homework Tracking & Motivation

## Project Overview

Aira is a chatbot designed to interact with users on WhatsApp, tracking their homework submissions and encouraging them to stay on track. It serves as a friendly reminder and motivational assistant, ensuring that students or users donâ€™t fall behind.

- **Motivate & Encourage:** Send automated, friendly nudges to users who have missed deadlines, encouraging them to complete their work.
- **Adaptable for Different Environments:** While initially designed for educational purposes, the bot can be adapted for use in other domains, such as reminders for tasks, projects, or even personal goals.
- **Easy Setup:** Built to be easy to integrate with WhatsApp via an API, with a simple configuration and minimal setup.

## Technologies Used

- WhatsApp API (Twilio, 360dialog, or similar)
- Python (Flask/FastAPI for backend)
- Google Sheets or Firebase for data storage (optional)
